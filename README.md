# Micro_Scale_Enterprise_Report
Hi Everyone,

This is a complete end to end Power Bi report for a Micro Scale Enterprise's sample data.

This data is a prototype of a real world data.

Problem statement of the client: - They wanted to know the current scenario of the company and the performance of their employees and the areas where they are doing well and the areas where they need improvement.

As a solution for the client I created a complete paginated project report indicating the total business analysis with required hierarchical Drill Downs and including the required DAX functions.

The report contains following characteristics: -

1. Visualizations for clear picture, creating a Mobile Layout Report, and much more.
2. The report is paginated having links for navigating on each section of the report. The data for sales can be filtered by month, customer-wise, employee wise and on the basis of work status for generated orders.
3. This report Shows the purchase data for the company along with the suppliers information.
4. This report shows all the dues i.e. accounts payable and receivable for the company.
5. This report Demonstrates the performance of the employees(Sales department).
6. This report demonstrates the Branch-wise sales and purchase data with appropriate slicers for filtering the data.
7. The summarized company data is also available for the upper level management.
8. This report SHows the Summarized Project and Branch-Wise Analysis.
